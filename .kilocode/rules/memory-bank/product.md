## Why This Project Exists

Property managers and landlords face significant inefficiencies in maintenance workflows. The traditional process of diagnosing maintenance issues, estimating costs, and determining appropriate responses requires manual assessment, research, and often multiple phone calls to contractors. This is time-consuming, error-prone, and delays critical repairs.

The AI-Assisted Property Maintenance Tool exists to automate and streamline this process by providing instant, AI-driven diagnostic assessments, cost estimates, and actionable recommendations. This enables property professionals to make faster, more informed decisions about maintenance issues.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Time-Consuming Diagnostics**: Property managers spend hours researching issues and calling contractors for basic diagnosis
2. **Inconsistent Cost Estimates**: Without standardized data, cost estimates vary widely and are often inaccurate
3. **Delayed Responses**: The manual process delays critical repairs, potentially worsening issues and increasing costs
4. **Lack of Expertise**: Many property managers lack technical knowledge to assess maintenance issues accurately
5. **Inefficient Workflows**: No centralized system to track, analyze, and manage maintenance requests

## How It Works

The tool follows a simple, streamlined workflow:

1. **User Authentication**: Property managers and landlords create secure accounts
2. **Issue Submission**: Users describe maintenance issues in natural language (optional property address and category)
3. **AI Analysis**: The AI analyzes the description and provides:
   - Problem diagnosis
   - Urgency classification (Low/Medium/High)
   - Estimated cost range
   - Recommended contractor type
   - Actionable next steps
4. **Results Display**: Analysis presented in clear, structured format
5. **History Tracking**: All requests saved for future reference with filtering capabilities

The entire analysis process completes in under 5 seconds, dramatically reducing the time from issue identification to actionable insights.
