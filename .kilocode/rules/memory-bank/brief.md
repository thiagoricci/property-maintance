- Generate initial revenue through paid users
- Demonstrate core AI-assisted maintenance analysis capabilities
- Provide foundation for future feature expansion

## KEY FEATURES

• User Authentication - Secure login and registration system
• Maintenance Request Submission - Text-based issue reporting with optional property details
• AI-Powered Analysis - Automated diagnosis with urgency classification, cost estimation, and contractor recommendations
• Request History Dashboard - Track and filter past maintenance requests
• Responsive Web Interface - Clean, functional UI optimized for desktop use

## TECHNOLOGY STACK

Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Next.js API Routes, NextAuth.js for authentication
AI Integration: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude
Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
